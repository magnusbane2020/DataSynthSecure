Prompt 1 â€” STEP 1: Secure Synthetic Data Creation

Objective: Create a realistic, safe, and security-conscious dataset of Salesforce opportunities.

You are tasked with creating synthetic Salesforce opportunity data for a professional evaluation at CrowdStrike (cybersecurity context).

ðŸ”¹ Requirements:

Generate 50 fake opportunities in Stage 1 (before qualification).

Use publicly traded company names (never real customer data).

Include standard SFDC fields: Opportunity Name, Account, Close Date, Stage, Amount, Owner, Created Date.

Add opportunity notes: Why? Why now? Why this product?

For ~50% of opportunities, populate MEDDPICC fields (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Paper Process, Identify Pain, Champion, Competition). Leave the others partially empty to reflect reality.

Ensure no personal data (PII) is included. All values must be synthetic.

ðŸ”¹ Security & Validation:

Treat all outputs as synthetic & anonymized.

Store results only in local CSV (synthetic_opportunities.csv) â€” no external uploads.

Print the first 5 rows for validation before saving the full dataset.

ðŸ”¹ Output:
A pandas-style DataFrame â†’ export to CSV. File should be clean, consistent, and reproducible.

Prompt 2 â€” STEP 2: Secure AI Assessment & Scoring

Objective: Evaluate each opportunity with AI scoring while ensuring secure handling of API keys and data.

From the dataset generated in Step 1, assess each opportunity using GenAI with secure Python integration.

ðŸ”¹ Requirements:

Write a Python script that calls an AI API (OpenAI / Claude / Snowflake Cortex trial).

API keys must be stored in environment variables (.env file or system environment) â€” never hardcoded.

For each opportunity, generate:

A score (0â€“100) for deal quality.

A concise explanation of the score.

Use frameworks like MEDDPICC, BANT, or hybrid scoring.

Time the scriptâ€™s execution from 0 â†’ 50 rows.

Save results to opportunity_scores.csv with [Opportunity ID, Score, Explanation].

ðŸ”¹ Security & Validation:

No API keys printed in logs.

No sensitive data stored or transmitted.

Run a test with 3 rows before scaling to all 50.

Confirm CSV format is clean before final run.

ðŸ”¹ Output:
A structured CSV of opportunity scores + runtime measurement.

Prompt 3 â€” STEP 3: Business Recommendation with Security Lens

Objective: Provide an executive-level report with cybersecurity-conscious recommendations.

Using the scoring results (opportunity_scores.csv), create a business recommendation report tailored to CrowdStrike leadership.

ðŸ”¹ Requirements:

Summarize scoring distribution and highlight key patterns (e.g., MEDDPICC-complete opportunities score higher).

Provide strategic recommendations for using AI scoring at scale:

Improvements (data quality checks, automation, enrichment).

Guardrails & Security Concerns:

Bias mitigation in scoring

Explainability for decision-making

GDPR/data residency compliance

Secure API usage (rotation of API keys, encrypted storage, principle of least privilege)

Lessons Learned from synthetic pilot.

Suggest next steps: integration into CRM workflows, dashboards, or pipeline prioritization.

ðŸ”¹ Security Emphasis:

Stress that no customer data was used (synthetic only).

Highlight compliance awareness (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA where relevant).

Note monitoring and audit trails as future enhancements.

ðŸ”¹ Output:
A concise, professional, leadership-ready report â€” written in business language with cybersecurity credibility.
