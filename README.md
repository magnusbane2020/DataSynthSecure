# 🛡️ DataSynthSecure

**DataSynthSecure** is a secure synthetic data generation and analysis framework designed for enterprise environments.  
It helps simulate, score, and analyze Salesforce-like opportunities with a focus on **bias detection**, **auditing**, and **compliance monitoring**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Synthetic Data Generator** – create realistic but safe opportunity datasets.
- **AI Scoring Engine** – score opportunities with MEDDPICC framework support.
- **Bias Detection Dashboard** – identify and reduce bias in generated datasets.
- **Audit Trail** – track and log all AI decisions for compliance.
- **Monitoring Dashboard** – real-time insights and executive reporting.
- **Replit + Streamlit** integration for rapid prototyping.
